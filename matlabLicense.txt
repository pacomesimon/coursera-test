How to get MATLAB

As a result of support from MathWorks, a license to MATLAB Online for the duration of the course is available. MATLAB Online gives you access to MATLAB directly from your browser on a computer with internet access. To get started using MATLAB Online:

1. If you do not already have a MathWorks account, create one here: https://www.mathworks.com/mwaccount/register. Be sure to verify your email (check your Junk/Spam folders) before moving on to step 2.

2. Set up your MathWorks account with MATLAB Online access by signing in using the course license: https://www.mathworks.com/licensecenter/classroom/intro_programming_ml/

3. After using the link in step 2 to login in MATLAB Online for the first time, bookmark https://matlab.mathworks.com to use MATLAB Online during the course.

MATLAB Online is supported in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
